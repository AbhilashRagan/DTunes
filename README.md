# DTunes
Delta_Force_Task_03
I have left DAuth, Artist Registration, Sync Playback and Party Mode.
I have not given few features to my design constraints, my architecture and the constraints in the SDK that I have used. 
I have given a "Link Spotify" button to link Spotify API. This is to ensure that user can know that I am using his Spotify account to play songs.
A Spotify Premium account is required in order to use this application.
